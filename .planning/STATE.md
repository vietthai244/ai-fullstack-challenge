## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent structural decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 10-phase fine-granularity plan; strict critical path 1→2→3→4→5, with P6 (tracking pixel) and P7 (backend tests) parallelizable against P5/P8
- Infra: full docker-compose wiring deferred to Phase 10; early phases develop against a local Postgres + Redis
- Tests: backend Vitest+Supertest isolated in Phase 7 to keep the critical path linear but parallelizable with frontend foundation
