# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-20)

**Core value:** Server-side business-rule correctness and clean, testable architecture — proven by tests and narrated through transparent AI collaboration.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Monorepo Foundation & Shared Schemas

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Monorepo Foundation & Shared Schemas) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4 (next: 01-04 cross-workspace import proof + acceptance gate)
Status: Executing Phase 1
Last activity: 2026-04-21 -- Plan 01-03 (pino logger module) completed

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 7%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 4.3min
- Total execution time: 0.14 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1     | 2     | 8.6min | 4.3min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3.3min), 01-02 (5.3min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent structural decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 10-phase fine-granularity plan; strict critical path 1→2→3→4→5, with P6 (tracking pixel) and P7 (backend tests) parallelizable against P5/P8
- Infra: full docker-compose wiring deferred to Phase 10; early phases develop against a local Postgres + Redis
- Tests: backend Vitest+Supertest isolated in Phase 7 to keep the critical path linear but parallelizable with frontend foundation
- Plan 01-02: Used corepack-shim `/usr/local/bin/yarn` (4.14.1) via absolute path because homebrew's `/opt/homebrew/bin/yarn` (1.22.19 classic) shadows by default — README in Phase 10 should document `corepack enable` requirement
- Plan 01-02: Added `typescript ^5.8.3` to `shared/package.json` devDependencies (Rule 2) — without it, `yarn workspace @campaign/shared typecheck` errors with `command not found: tsc` because Yarn 4 workspace-scripts don't see root's hoisted .bin
- Plan 01-02: Added `.planning` + `.docs` to `.prettierignore` (Rule 3) — protects GSD planning state and reviewer's spec per CLAUDE.md guardrail + threat T-02-04
